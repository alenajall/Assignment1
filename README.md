Mini Library Management System

This repository presents the implementation of a Mini Library Management System developed in Python as part of Assignment 1 for the Object-Oriented Programming 1 course. The system demonstrates fundamental object-oriented design principles through the use of classes, data structures, and modular programming techniques.

Repository Contents
library.py – Contains the core implementation of the system, including class definitions, data structures, and associated methods.

unit_tests.py – Provides unit tests utilizing assert statements to validate the correctness and reliability of system functions.

demo.py – A demonstration script that illustrates the main features of the system, such as adding, borrowing, returning, and deleting books.

UML.png – A hand-drawn UML diagram depicting the relationships among the system’s components and their respective attributes and methods.

DesignRationale.txt – A document providing a detailed explanation of design decisions, with a particular focus on the choice and application of data structures (dictionaries, lists, and tuples).

README.md – The present document, outlining the system’s structure, setup, and execution guidelines.


Execution Instructions
Prerequisites

Python 3.x must be installed on the system prior to execution.

Running the Demonstration

Ensure that library.py, demo.py, and unit_tests.py are located within the same directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

To execute the demonstration and observe the system’s functionality, run the following command:

python demo.py


To execute the unit tests and verify the correctness of system operations, use:

python unit_tests.py
