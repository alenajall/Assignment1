Mini Library Management System

This repository contains the implementation of a Mini Library Management System in Python, fulfilling the requirements of Assignment 1 for Object-Oriented Programming 1.

 Files
- library.py: Core implementation with data structures and functions.
- unit_tests.py: Unit tests using `assert` to verify functionality.
- demo.py: Demo script showcasing system usage (add, borrow, return, delete).
- UML.png: Hand-drawn UML diagram showing data structures and functions.
- DesignRationale.txt: Document explaining the use of dictionaries, lists, and tuples.
- README.md: This file with instructions.

 Instructions to Run the Code

 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

 Running the Demo
1. Ensure `library.py` is in the same directory as `demo.py`and unit_test.py
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the demo script using:# Mini Library Management System
